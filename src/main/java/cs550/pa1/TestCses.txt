Test Environment :
1. Atleast 3 peers.
2. Atleast 10 files of varying length in each peer.
3. Some files are registered from more than 1 peer.


Test cases :

1. register(file name ): Peer is Indexing a file with Index Server.(Multiple peers Indexing at the same time).
2. lookup(file name) : Peer is Looking up a file with Index Server.(Multiple peers looking up at the same time).
3. download(file name, peer address) : a peer(acting as client) downloads a file from another peer ( acting as server). (a peer(server) should 	  be able to handle multiple download requests from another peer(client))
4.Automatic notification to Index server when a file is deleted/addition from a peer folder.(addition is optional)

Threading issues to be taken care of:
1. Synchronization 
2. Consistency 

Evaluation and measurement :
1. Respose time for a file looking on Index server.
   - time taken for 1000 lookups
   - time taken for each lookup when there are multiple lookup requests
   - changes number of concurrent lookups and see how response time varies (plots to support the observations)
